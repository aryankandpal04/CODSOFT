            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as the 'Father of the Nation,' was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, Gandhi is renowned for his philosophy of non-violence (Ahimsa) and his unwavering commitment to social justice and equality.</p>
            <p>His leadership in the Indian struggle for independence from British rule was marked by his innovative use of non-violent civil disobedience. Gandhi's methods of peaceful protest and his principles of self-sufficiency and simplicity inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</p>
